initially token have TSA://ProcUnique attribute with 2 UINT64
the second UINT64 value is always (in tests) equal TokenId+1
so probably ZwAllocateLocallyUniqueId used for create it, just after init TokenId ( Specifies a locally unique identifier (LUID) that identifies this instance of the token object)
